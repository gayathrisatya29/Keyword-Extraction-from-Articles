# Keyword-Extraction-from-Articles
In the digital era, vast amounts of textual information are generated daily across various platforms, including news websites, academic journals, blogs, and social media. Managing and making sense of this unstructured data has become increasingly important for improving search engine performance, content classification, summarization, and recommendation systems. One of the key techniques in handling textual data efficiently is keyword extraction, which involves identifying the most relevant and representative words or phrases from a document.
Keywords help summarize the content, capture the main themes, and serve as crucial metadata for indexing and retrieval. Traditional keyword extraction methods, such as TF-IDF and frequency-based approaches, are simple and fast but often fail to consider the semantic context, domain-specific terms, and multi-word expressions. These limitations make them less effective for modern applications that require deeper language understanding.
This project aims to develop an automated keyword extraction system using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging context-aware algorithms, the system will be able to extract more accurate and meaningful keywords from a variety of articles. The proposed approach will address key challenges such as language ambiguity, synonymy, and adaptability across different content domains, contributing to more intelligent and scalable text processing solutions.
